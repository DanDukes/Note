## Functionality
The note application allows for users to read, write, update, and delete notes.  It uses a static JSON file as the Modal, storing notes as objects.  The express application handles data parsing, html routing, and uses a controller to handle api routing.  The view is static and served via publis html, css, and JavaScript files.  Dynamic rendering is handled via JQuery on the client side.
